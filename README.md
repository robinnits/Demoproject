# Demoproject

Welcome to my fun little project repo!

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
I was feeling a bit bored, thought of Rock-Paper-Scissors, and ended up building this mini terminal-based game where you can play against your computer!

### How to Play
- Run the program.
- Enter your choice: Rock (`r`), Paper (`p`), or Scissors (`s`).
- The computer randomly chooses, and the winner is decided!

## 🚀 More Coming Soon
I'll be uploading more fun and interesting code projects here — stay tuned!
